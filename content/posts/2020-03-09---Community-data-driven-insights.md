In 2018, [UM](https://library.maastrichtuniversity.nl/) launched their first and joint ‘data-driven’ initiative towards [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) university. The Community for Data Driven Insights [(CDDI)](https://library.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research-support/rdm/cddi/) governance structure is in place and they explore the ways to turn its FAIR ambitions into reality. CDDI is designed to open up a space where relevant stakeholders work together on specific issues for the realisation of the 2025 Agenda.

I'm helping UM towards this goal, to become first FAIR University by 2025, by implementing FAIR principles along diverse research projects and applying data science, particularly Semantic Web technologies.
